## Overview

**ExaChem** is a suite of scalable electronic structure methods to perform ground and excited-state calculations on molecular systems. These methodologies are implemented using the **T**ensor **A**lgebra for **M**any-body **M**ethods ([TAMM](https://github.com/NWChemEx-Project/TAMM)) library. TAMM is a parallel tensor algebra library for performance-portable development of scalable electronic structure methods that can be run on modern exascale computing platforms. The ExaChem computational chemistry suite currently includes implementations of: Hartree-Fock (HF), MP2, CCSD, CCSD(T), CCSD-Lambda, EOM-CCSD, RT-EOM-CCSD, and GFCCSD. Additional capabilities are available via interfaces to other open-source libraries. The ExaChem suite and TAMM library are actively being developed and maintained at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory ([PNNL](https://pnnl.gov)) and distributed as open-source under the terms of the Apache License version 2.0.
