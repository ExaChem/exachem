## Overview

**ExaChem** is a suite of scalable electronic structure methods to perform ground and excited-state calculations on molecular systems. It is currently being developed synergistically with the [NWChemEx](https://nwchemex.github.io/NWChemEx), [SPEC](https://spec.labworks.org/home), QIS, and [MAPOL](https://github.com/mapol-chem) projects (please see acknowledgements). The methodologies in ExaChem are implemented using the **T**ensor **A**lgebra for **M**any-body **M**ethods ([TAMM](https://github.com/NWChemEx/TAMM)) library. TAMM is a parallel tensor algebra library for performance-portable development of scalable electronic structure methods that can be run on modern exascale computing platforms. ExaChem  currently includes native implementations of: Hartree-Fock (HF), MP2, CC2, CCSD, CCSD(T), CCSD-Lambda, EOM-CCSD, RT-EOM-CCSD, GFCCSD, and double unitary coupled-cluster (DUCC). ExaChem has also been interfaced with the [GauXC library](https://github.com/wavefunction91/GauXC) to enable DFT calculations.

ExaChem and TAMM are actively being developed and maintained at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory ([PNNL](https://pnnl.gov)) and distributed as open-source under the terms of the Apache License version 2.0.
