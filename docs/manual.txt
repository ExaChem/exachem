GFCCExlib is a numerical library that is able to perfrom Green's function coupled-cluster (GFCC) calculations.

Main features of the first version of GFCCExlib,
(1) on-the-fly Cholesky decomposition for two-electron integrals,
(2) Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization for multidimensional complex tensors,
(3) Krylov subspace interpolation and extrapolation procedure for complex linear systems,
(4) multidimensional complex tensor contractions,
(5) checkpointing/restarting capability based on parallel I/O for the distributed file.
